# Line Width Indicator

Tired of guessing how many more characters you can type before your formatter decides its time to wrap to the next line? What about those hefty rulers that seem out of place? Wouldn't it be nice to have a visual indicator as you type?

This is exactly what Line Width Indicator does!
It simply places a counter at the end of each line that indicates how many characters you have left before you reach a settings configurable value.

## Features

Currently the indicator is shown and updates as you type with predefined colors that can be adjusted in the settings.

#### Future Plans

1. Automatic comment insertion which prevents default formatter from acting on the line. Only added when a given threshold is passed.
2. Formatting trigger when limit is reached
3. Position and/or style indicator configured in settings
4. Position of comments configured in settings (same line or above)
5. Incorporate user feedback!
