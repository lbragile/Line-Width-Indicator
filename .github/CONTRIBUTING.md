## Contributing 😍

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via an issue, email (lbragile@gmail.com), or direct GitHub message before making a change. This will ensure that your changes have a high likely hood of being approved. You can find a list of features that need to be integrated into LWI at [Projects > Todo](https://github.com/lbragile/Line-Width-Indicator/projects/1"). This list is great for anyone who wants to contribute features from minor (low priority) to major (high priority) that LWI users indicated they would like to see in future iterations.

### First Time? 🆕

If this is your first time contributing to a project, please see the following step by step [guide](https://akrabat.com/the-beginners-guide-to-contributing-to-a-github-project/).

### Process 📋

1. Update the [README.md](https://github.com/lbragile/Line-Width-Indicator/blob/master/README.md) file with details of changes you've made. Be as detailed as possible. Further explanation of reasoning/logic that does not fit in the README file, should go as a comment in the Pull Request.
2. Adjust the version number in `manifest.json` using the [SemVer](https://semver.org/) versioning scheme.
3. Continuous Integration (CI) is added to automate the PR process. Make sure you have tested your added functionality to ensure code coverage thresholds are met. Otherwise, your PR will be automatically rejected.
4. Once your PR passes the CI check and is reviewed by me, I will either accept it as is (and merge it in) or ask you to make corrections.
